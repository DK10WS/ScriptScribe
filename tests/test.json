As I walked through the remnants of what was once a bustling city, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and reverence for the people who had walked these streets centuries ago. Nature had begun to reclaim its territory, with vines snaking up the sides of crumbling temples and trees growing through the remains of old dwellings. It was a poignant reminder of the impermanence of human achievements and the enduring power of time."
